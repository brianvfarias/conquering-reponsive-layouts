# Conquering responsive layouts

### A 21 days challenge

This repository contains all the code I've develop through the course Conquering responsive layouts and also some notes in order to understand the concepts explained in the course.

## Why I started taking this course?

Recently I was challenged to develop a complete responsive layout and, although I was able to deliver all the code in due time, I had a lot of trouble doing so.

This situation showed me that I need more practice with the fundamentals of development, and that is the reason why I chose to take this course I improve myself on this matter!
