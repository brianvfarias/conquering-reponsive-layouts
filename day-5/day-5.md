# Day 5

On Day 5 I saw the solution to challenge 2 and... I'm a little ashame of my own solution. Mine works just fine, but I could've thought of something better. Anyhow, I'm linking the updated version of challenge 2 here, so you can see how it was improve. Also, I'm keeping the first solution just as it was done in this repository, just so I does not seen like I'm cheating.

On day 5 I didn't have much time to focus on learning and trying new things beyond what was seen in the course, so I just started solving challenge 3!
