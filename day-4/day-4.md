# Learning about other css units

On the course, it is shown a bit more about some other css units, such as, vh and vw.

Since there was little to learn in this class, I challenge myself developing this little responsive project in order to try and use everything I've learned so far!

I am a little proud of it, so I'll share the link of the codepen I used to practice but I'll also leave the code here on this repository.

As you can see in the code, I've switched from _max-width_ to the CSS function _clamp()_ since I found it a more elegant approach.
