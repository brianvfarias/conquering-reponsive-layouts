# Day 2

On day 2 we are encouraged to practice a little bit more with _em_ and _rem_ units.

It is shown how font-sizes set in _ems_ can be chaotic.

In order to share that practice here, but keep the code clean, I've created a 'pen' on CodePen.

Here is the link:

## Combining the 2 units

In order to keep the consistency of the layouts it is important to now how and when to use both units.

1. Never use _ems_ to set the font size of elements

2. _ems_ are good to keep some elements proportional when the font size shrinks or grow (usually by the effect of a media query or such)

3. _rem_ are way more consistent and are better when use to set margins and gaps for example.
